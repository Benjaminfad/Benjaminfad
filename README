Hello there ‚úäüèæ
My name is Benjamin Fadipe 

A Frontend web developer/ Tech enthusiast 


I am a positive, enthusiastic, and competent Frontend developer, 
who in the space of 2 years have taken certificate based courses 
on Web development which has improved my skills and ability. 
I have experience working alone and would love to also be part of a team.
I am open to work as part of the development team in your reputable organization/company 
I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and 
perpetually working on improving my skills daily.
